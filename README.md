   # Netflix Analysis using Jupyter Notebook
Using Jupter notebook, I was able to get some basic information about a 2022 Netflix data set I downloaded from kaggle, such as the
   * The first 5 top records of the data set
   * The bottom 5 records of the data set
   * The number of rows and columns
   * The Total values(elements) in a dataset
   * The name of each column In the dataset
   * The datatype of each column
   * The Information of each column such as indexes, columns, data-types and its memory usage.

I also performed edits on the Netflix data set using Jupyter Notebook, Which Include: 
* Checking for duplicates on the data set and removing any duplicates if there are. 
* Checking for any Null Value present in any column and displaying those Null values on a Heatmap.

I also queried the Netflix data set using Jupyter Notebook and answered the following: 
* The show id and the Director for the show 'You'.
* The year that had the highest amount of Tv shows and Movies that were added to Netflix and displaying the result on a bar Graph.
* The amount of movies and TV shows are in the datasets and displaying the results on a bar graph.
* All the movies released in the year 2000.
* The title of all TV Shows that were released in Nigeria only.
* The Top directors who gave the highest number of TV shows and movies to Netflix.
* All records where "rating is PG-13 and type is Movie" or "country is United Kingdom".
